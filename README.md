# Hand-Interfaces

The repo contains important scripts to implement retrieval pipeline, and three representative types of interfaces.

**InterfaceRetrieval.cs**: 
Interface retrieval pipeline with three example interfaces: scissors, joystick and binoculars. Developers can add other interfaces by editing the object dictionary.

**VirtualScissors.cs**: 
Interaction for Scissors (represent interfaces requiring only one emulating hand, without interacting hand)

**VirtualJoystick.cs**: 
Interaction for Joystick (represents interfaces requiring one hand as the emulating hand and the other as the interacting hand)

**VirtualBinoculars.cs**: 
Interaction for Binoculars (represent interfaces requiring two emulating hands)
